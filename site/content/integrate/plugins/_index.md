## Features

### Customize user interfaces

Write a Web App plugin to add to the channel header, sidebars, main menu, and more. Register your plugin against a post type to render custom posts or wire up a root component to build an entirely new experience. All this is possible without having to fork the source code and rebase on every Mattermost release.

### Launch tightly-integrated services

Launch and manage Server plugins as services from your Mattermost server over RPC. Handle events via real-time hooks and invoke Mattermost server methods directly using a dedicated plugin API.

### Extend the Mattermost REST API

Extend the Mattermost REST API with custom endpoints for use by Web App plugins or third-party services. Custom endpoints have access to all the features of the standard Mattermost REST API, including personal access tokens and OAuth 2.0.

### Simple development and installation

It's simple to set up a plugin development environment with the {{< newtabref href="https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-starter-template" title="mattermost-plugin-starter-template" >}}. Just select "Use this template" when cloning the repository.
