Mattermost provides an API library for Golang, called a **driver**, that allows convenient access to the Apps API and the Mattermost REST API.
It is a wrapper around HTTP REST calls and should be used when you do not want to implement REST calls directly.

For more information, see the [Golang]({{< ref "/integrate/apps/drivers/golang" >}}) driver page.
