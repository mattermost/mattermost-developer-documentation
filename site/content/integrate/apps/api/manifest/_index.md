All apps should define a manifest
([godoc](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-apps/apps#Manifest))
as a JSON file. The fields of the manifest are:

| Name                    | Type        | Description                                                                                                                              |

| `requested_permissions` | Permissions | All the permissions needed by the app.                                                                                                   |
| `requested_locations`   | Locations   | The list of top-level locations that the application intends to bind to.                                                                 |
| `bindings`              | Call        | The call gets invoked to retrieve bindings. By default invoke `/bindings`.                                                               |
| `on_disable`            | Call        | The call gets invoked when the app is disabled after having been enabled.                                                                |
| `on_enable`             | Call        | The call gets invoked when the app is enabled after having been disabled.                                                                |

| `on_uninstall`          | Call        | The call gets invoked when the app gets uninstalled, before the app is actually removed.                                                 |

- (*) `app_id` and `homepage_url` must be provided and valid.
- `on_...` callbacks are not invoked unless explicitly provided in the manifest.
`bindings` defaults to `/bindings` with nothing expanded.
- In addition, an app must define at least one of the following deployment types, as a section
in its `manifest.json`: `"http"`, `"aws_lambda"`, `"kubeless"`, or
`"open_faas"`.

An example manifest looks like this:
```json
{
	"app_id": "hello-world",
    "version":"v0.8.0",
	"display_name": "Hello, world!",
	"icon": "icon.png",
	"homepage_url": "https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-apps/examples/go/hello",
	"requested_permissions": [
		"act_as_bot"
	],
	"requested_locations": [
		"/channel_header",
		"/command"
	],
	"http": {
		"root_url": "http://localhost:4000"
	}
}
```

### Permissions

Apps need to request permissions from the admin who is installing them. After an app is installed and available to end users, each user in Mattermost will need to "authenticate" with your app. Using the `act_as_user` permission, your app will be performing an API call on each authenticated user's behalf.

Below are the permissions ([godoc](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-apps/apps#Permission)) an app can currently ask for:

| Name                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| :--------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `user_joined_channel_notification` | Be notified when users join channels.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `act_as_bot`                       | Use Mattermost REST API as the app's bot user.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `act_as_user`                      | Use Mattermost REST API as connected users.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `act_as_admin`                     | Use Mattermost REST API as a System Admin. This gives permission for an App to use certain API endpoints that are reserved for administrators. Use this permission only if required (ie: your App is designed to help maintain or automate certain administrator actions). |
| `remote_oauth2`                    | Use remote (third-party) OAuth2 support, and will store secrets and tokens to third-party system(s) within the Mattermost server.                                                                                                                                          |
| `remote_webhooks`                  | Receive webhooks from a remote (third-party) system, and process them as a bot (which will typically, will add a notification message to a channel)                                                                                                                        |


### Locations

Locations ([godoc](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-apps/apps#Location)) are spaces in the UI where an app can add interactions. Locations in the App framework are supported on the Mobile/Desktop/Webapp clients unless otherwise noted. This list of locations will grow over time as the App Framework expands.

| Name              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/post_menu`      | An item in a Mattermost post's dropdown menu (aka Message Action) where the user can leverage the message content as part of your App's action. A good example for using the post menu: someone reports a bug in a channel with some details, then using the "post-menu" button the message's content could be used to create a new "bug" object in a tracking system.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `/channel_header` | Webapp: A button in the channel header, Mobile: An item in the channel menu. This is used for actions that take place at the channel level, for example a button for the user to set up a notification subscription for all new tickets in system XYZ to be posted to the current channel                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `/command`        | A slash command accessed by typing `/` at the beginning of any new message in Mattermost. Slash commands are an easy way for power-users to perform actions in external systems via a "chat-command-line" that can interactively provide the users with hints and suggestions based on dynamic lookups. For example, a slash command `/ticketing --name "test Ticket" --priority high` can capture two fields and create a ticket in an external system. The options for "priority" field could be displayed to the user in a multi-select menu to reduce their need to type. |
| `/in_post`        | A form that is embedded within a message in Mattermost. Used to interact with users without switching context to an Interactive Dialog. Great for confirming simple things - like "Did you complete your OKR review yet? (Yes/No) options can be presented to the user and they can simply check off a box.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
