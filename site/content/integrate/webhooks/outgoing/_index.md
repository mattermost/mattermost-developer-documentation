Outgoing webhooks let you receive an event as an HTTP POST when messages get posted into a Mattermost channel, with the option to respond with your own message.

They can be configured to send events for one or both of the following conditions:

* A message is posted in a specific channel
* The first word of a message matches or starts with one of the configured trigger words
