Heads up that with [PR#1239](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-webapp/pull/1239), we're effectively switching to [npm@6](https://medium.com/npm-inc/announcing-npm-6-5d0b1799a905).

### Why the change?

Previously, doing a fresh `npm install` would unexpectedly change `package-lock.json`. Upgrading to npm@6 should resolve this going forward.

### What do I need to do?

Make sure you're running npm@6:
```bash
npm install -g npm@6
```
