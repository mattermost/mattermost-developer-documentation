With Mattermost's rich RESTful web service API and OAuth 2.0 support it's possible to build your own clients to embed Mattermost within any application of your choice.

## Embedding Methods

### Browser Extensions and Add-Ons

Many modern browsers have support for extensions or add-ons that would allow you to build and embed a Mattermost client on web pages of your choice. Chrome has [extensions](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions), Firefox has [add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/), and IE/Edge have [extensions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/extensions).

We have an open-source [demo Chrome extension](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-chrome-extension) that demonstrates how to get an access token for a user. You can use this demo extension as a starting point for building your embedded Mattermost client.

### JavaScript Widget

If you have access to modify the pages of the application you would like to embed Mattermost into, it is possible to create a JavaScript widget that can be included on those pages.

Getting a user's access token could be done using the OAuth 2.0 implicit grant flow, similar to browser extensions. There are many JavaScript libraries that make using OAuth 2.0 simple, for example [client-oauth2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/client-oauth2).
