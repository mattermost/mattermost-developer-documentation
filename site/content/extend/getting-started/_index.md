Mattermost can be extended by building and installing plugins, by embedding Mattermost in another application, or by forking the codebase.

## Extension Methods

### Plugins (Beta)

Plugins are easy to build, effortless to maintain, and offer powerful new options to add functionality and UI to the server and web/desktop apps in ways not available with any other integration method.

### Embed

Mattermost is a great communication platform but sometimes it's more convenient to send and receive messages from within a non-Mattermost application. With Mattermost's rich RESTful web service API and OAuth 2.0 support it's possible to build your own clients to embed Mattermost within any application of your choice.

### Fork

Mattermost is open-source, which means you have the ability to fork the source code if you need to modify Mattermost in ways not otherwise supported.
