The [Focalboard](https://www.focalboard.com) / [Mattermost Boards](https://mattermost.com/boards) project is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Go](https://go.dev/).

Here's the process for contributing to Focalboard:

1. Fork the [Focalboard repository](https://github.com/mattermost/focalboard), clone it locally, and follow the steps in the [Personal Server Setup Guide](personal-server-setup-guide) to build it. You can read the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/mattermost/focalboard/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) to learn about recent updates.

2. Find [help wanted tickets that are up for grabs in GitHub](https://github.com/mattermost/focalboard/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Up+for+grabs%22+label%3A%22Help+Wanted%22). Comment to let everyone know you’re working on it and let a core contributor assign the issue to you. If there’s no ticket for what you want to work on, read about [contributions without a ticket](../getting-started/contributions-without-ticket).

3. When your changes are checked in to your fork, follow the steps on our [contribution checklist](../getting-started/contribution-checklist). If this will be your first contribution, there is a standard [CLA](https://www.mattermost.org/mattermost-contributor-agreement/) that you will need to sign as part of this checklist.

5. Submit your pull request for a [code review](../getting-started/code-review/#if-you-are-a-community-member-seeking-a-review) and [wait](../getting-started/code-review/#if-you-are-awaiting-a-review) for a [Focalboard core committer](https://github.com/mattermost/focalboard/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributors) to review it. When in doubt, ask for help in the [Focalboard channel](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/focalboard) on our community server. If you are still stuck, please message Chen Lim ([@chenilim](https://github.com/chenilim) on GitHub).

6. After a noteable bug fix or improvement is merged, submit a pull request to the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/mattermost/focalboard/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) under the next release section.

We're glad ❤️ you're here! Good luck and have fun!
