Mattermost plugins are isolated pieces of code written in Go and/or React. They're separate from the main repositories and are used to extend the functionality of the Mattermost server and webapp. 

- The Go portions run directly on the Mattermost server, and are managed by the server at runtime. 
- The React portions run in each user's browser, allowing developers to modify the user interface in [several ways](/extend/plugins/webapp/best-practices/).

The plugin Help Wanted tickets are located in each plugin's respective GitHub repository. In order to browse all of the open tickets, see the plugin [Help Wanted tickets](https://mattermost.com/pl/help-wanted-plugins/) page with links to specific plugin repositories, as well as queries for Help Wanted tickets in all repositories.

The plugin [developer setup](/extend/plugins/developer-setup/) and [developer workflow](/extend/plugins/developer-workflow/) pages are useful to learn about the plugin development environment. You can find more information about plugins in general [here](/extend/plugins/).
