Approximately once a month, a member of the Mattermost team releases a developer talk that discusses the architecture, design principles, and tools that the Mattermost project uses.

On this page, you'll find a list of those dev talks. They are also available on [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNR05H72hi692y01bWaFXNA).
