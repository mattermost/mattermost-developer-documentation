1. All help wanted tickets are under [server repository's GitHub issues](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/issues?q=label%3A%22Area%2FE2E+Tests%22+label%3A%22Up+For+Grabs%22+is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+). Look for issues with `Area/E2E Tests` and `Up For Grabs` labels, and comment to let everyone know you're working on it.
2. Each ticket is filled with specific test steps and verifications that need to be accomplished as a minimum requirement.  Additional steps and assertions for robust test implementation are very welcome.
3. Join our channel at [UI Test Automation](https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/ui-test-automation) and talk to us as fellow contributors, and collaborate and learn with one another.
