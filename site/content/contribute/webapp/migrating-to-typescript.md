The Mattermost team wants to proactively improve the quality, security, and stability of [the code](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-webapp), and one way to do this is by introducing the usage of type checking. Thus, we have decided to introduce Typescript in our codebase as it's a mature and feature-rich approach. 

As a first step, we have migrated the [mattermost-redux](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-redux) library to use Typescript, and are now in the process of migrating the [webapp](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-webapp) to use Typescript.

This campaign will help with the migration by converting files written in Javascript to type-safe files written in Typescript.

By completing this campaign, we're looking to:

- Reduce the errors derived from changes.
- Increase the consistency of the code.
- Ensure a more defensive programming in the code.

## Component Migration Steps

There are a few steps involved with migrating a file to use Typescript. Some of them may not apply to every file and they may change slightly based on the file you're working on. In general, you can follow these steps as a checklist for work that needs to be done on each file.

1. Every React component's set of `props` needs to be converted to a new type. You can use the component's `propTypes` as a template for what `props` a given component can expect. This conversion to Typescript includes maintaining whether a given `prop` is required or not. An optional property in Typescript is noted by including a question mark at the end of the property's name.
2. A component's `state` also needs to be defined using a type. The initial `state` assignment and any call to `setState` will be indicators of what values are present in the component's state.
3. Once a component's `props` and `state` (if any) have been converted, you can define the component as `class MyComponent extends React.PureComponent<Props, State>`. You can omit the `State` portion if the component does not have its own `state`.
4. Avoid use of the `any` type except in test files. The components themselves should be as well-defined as possible.
5. Most objects we used are typed in the [mattermost-redux](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-redux) library, if you can't find a type you're looking for.
6. Check that the types are all correct using the `make check-types` command.
