This serves as a guide to help contributors write end-to-end tests with Cypress, and as a reference when reviewing a pull request. This section includes compilation of all Cypress custom commands based on specific section of the web application. The examples provided showcase the best practices and convention on how to write better automated test scripts.
We encourage everyone to read this information, ask questions if something is not clear, and challenge mentioned practices so we can continuously refine and improve.
