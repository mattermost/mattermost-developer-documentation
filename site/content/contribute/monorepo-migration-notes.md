If you are transitioning from the non-monorepo ``mattermost-server`` to the monorepo, the easiest way to do so is to move the old mattermost server folder to something like ``mattermost-server-old`` then re-clone mattermost-server.
Then:

1. Copy over your old config

    ```sh
    cd server
    cp ../../mattermost-server-old/config/config.json ./config/
    ```

1. Copy over your developer config override

    ```sh
    cd server
    cp ../../mattermost-server-old/config.override.mk ./
    ```

1. Update your development Docker containers for the new location of the server folder

    ```sh
    cd server
    make update-docker
    ```
