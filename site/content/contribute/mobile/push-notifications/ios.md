Push notifications on iOS are managed and dispatched using [Apple's Push Notification Service](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/APNSOverview.html). You must have a **Paid Apple Developer account** to create certificates needed to send notifications using this service.

- Generate a Certificate from Keychain Access
    - Launch the **Keychain Access application** in your Mac and select **KeyChain Access -\Certificate Assistant -\Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authority...**

At this point, you can build the Mattermost app for iOS and use the above downloaded certificate to setup the [Mattermost Push Notification Service](/contribute/mobile/push-notifications/service/).
