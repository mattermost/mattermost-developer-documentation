Push notifications on Android are managed and dispatched using [Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)](http://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/)

- Create a Firebase project within the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com).

- Click **Add Project**

- Enter the project name, project ID and Country

- Click **CREATE PROJECT**

Once the project is created you'll be redirected to the Firebase project
dashboard

- Click **Add Firebase to your Android App**
- Enter the package ID of your custom Mattermost app as the **Android package name**.
- Enter an **App nickname** so you can identify it with ease
- Click **REGISTER APP**
- Once the app has been registered, download the **google-services.json** file which will be used later

- Click **CONTINUE** and then **FINISH**

Now that you have created the Firebase project and the app and
downloaded the *google-services.json* file, you need to make some
changes in the project.

- Replace `android/app/google-services.json` with the one you downloaded earlier

At this point, you can build the Mattermost app for Android and setup the [Mattermost Push Notification Service](/contribute/mobile/push-notifications/service/).
