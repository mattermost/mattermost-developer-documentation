This page describes how to write and run End-to-End (E2E) testing for Mobile Apps for both iOS and Android. We are using [Detox](https://github.com/wix/Detox) which is a "gray box end-to-end testing and automation library for mobile apps." See its [documentation](https://github.com/wix/Detox/tree/master/docs) to learn more.
