## Subsection 1 — Be inclusive

1. Hatred of any type is not welcome at Mattermost — harassment of any kind is grounds for immediate expulsion from this community.
2. Bias can exist without hatred, so it’s always worth considering how to be more inclusive.
    1. Depictions and representations of people should always be diverse in context. Where it’s possible, show people of different genders, races, and cultures. This also applies to choosing speakers at events. See the Mattermost Compass Design System's [Illustrations page](https://zeroheight.com/29be2c109/p/712d31-illustrations) for diversity examples.
    2. Keep those with visual and auditory impairments in mind by using semantic and meaningful organization in documents, adding alternate text to images, and giving videos subtitles in American English.
    3. Make sure not to accidentally discriminate by economic situation or physical location when making tooling, scheduling, and speaker management decisions.
3. Everyone has the right to voice concerns about perceived discrimination, but be gentle even if the other person is not. Start with a kind private message to avoid embarrassment, but you can report the offender to whoever is in charge of the space in which the discrimination occurred. Be forgiving, especially if the person makes an effort to improve.

## Subsection 2 — Work together

1. Use established escalation paths to avoid and resolve debates. 
2. Always aim for clarity and conciseness. Plain, professional, and descriptive language solves many communication issues and avoids excluding those with learning disabilities, with different learning styles, and with less experience in this industry.
    1. Don’t confuse conciseness with under-explaining. Give all of the context that your audience needs to have an informed opinion.
3. Emphasize similarities over differences. The “yes, and…” attitude can turn disagreements into productive dialogue.
4. Don’t abuse goodwill. Time is a valuable resource like money, so ask for it only after doing your own due diligence.
5. This isn’t the place for controversy.
6. None of us have all the answers, all the time. Crave feedback, and make a habit of giving it regularly and kindly.
7. Be grateful. A simple “thank you” can validate much expended effort.
8. Respect the time of others by setting reasonable and flexible deadlines.
9. Ask questions. Sometimes context is lost when communicating through text, so it’s often worth asking what influenced the decisions we don’t understand.
10. Protect the personal information of yourself and others. Do what you can and escalate if necessary to remove IP addresses, passwords, and API keys from public forums, channels, and open-source code.
