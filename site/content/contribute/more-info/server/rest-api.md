The REST API is a JSON web service that facilitates communication between Mattermost clients, as well as integrations, and the server. The server is currently on API version 4.

### Reference

Looking for the API reference? You can find it here: {{<newtabref title="https://api.mattermost.com" href="https://api.mattermost.com">}}.

### Add an endpoint

To add an endpoint to API version 4, all of the following must be completed:

- [Document the endpoint](#document-the-endpoint)
- [Implement the API handler](#implement-the-api-handler)
- [Add a function to the Go driver](#update-the-golang-driver)
- [Write a unit test](#write-a-unit-test)
- [Submit your implementation!](#submit-your-pull-request-pr)

#### Document the endpoint
At Mattermost, the [OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md) is used for API documentation. The API documentation lives in the main Mattermost repository alongside the server: [api](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/tree/master/api).

To document an endpoint, follow these steps:

1. Find the `.yaml` file in the [api/v4/source](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/tree/master/api/v4/source) directory that fits your endpoint.
    - For example, if you were adding the `GET /users/{user_id}` endpoint you would be looking for the [users.yaml](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/blob/master/api/v4/source/users.yaml) file.
    - If the file doesn't exist yet, you may need to create it and then update the [Makefile](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/tree/master/api/Makefile) to include the file.

2. Copy an existing endpoint from the same or a different file.

3. Update the documentation you copied with the correct information for your endpoint, including:
    - `Tag` - the resource type
    - `Summary` - a summary of few words
    - `Description` - a brief 1-2 sentence description
    - `Permissions` - the permission(s) required
    - `Parameters` - the URL and body parameters
    - `Responses` - the success and error responses

4.  Confirm you don't have any syntax errors by running `make build` within the [api](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/tree/master/api/) directory.

5.  Continue with the implementation of your API handler, updating this documentation as needed.

#### Implement the API handler
To implement the API handler, you'll first need to [setup your developer environment]({{< ref "/contribute/developer-setup" >}}), and then follow these steps:

1.  Add the declaration for your endpoint. For an example, check out the [/api4/user.go](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/blob/master/server/channels/api4/user.go) file.

2.  Implement the handler for your endpoint. Follow this general pattern for handlers:

    ```Go
    func handlerName(c *Context, w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        // 1. Parse the request URL and body.
        // 2. Do a permissions check if required.
        // 3. Invoke handler logic through the app package.
        // 4. (Optional) Check the Etag.
        // 5. Format the response and write the response.
    }
    ```
    For examples, see the [createUser()](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/blob/d693f880431741e3e1482503c4e80d6148b0f1bf/server/channels/api4/user.go#L111) and the [getUser()](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/blob/d693f880431741e3e1482503c4e80d6148b0f1bf/server/channels/api4/user.go#L177) handlers.

3.  Run the server by runing `make run-server` within the [server](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/tree/master/server/) directory.

4.  Use `curl` or {{<newtabref title="Postman" href="https://www.getpostman.com/">}} to test the basics of your endpoint.

#### Update the Golang driver
The Go driver for APIv4 is in [/model/client4.go](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/blob/master/server/public/model/client4.go). To add a function to support your new endpoint:

1.  Copy over an existing driver function, such as [CreateUser](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/blob/master/server/public/model/client4.go#L827).

2.  Paste the function into the section for your endpoint. For example, `POST /teams` would go in the Teams section.

3.  Modify the function to correctly hit your endpoint. Make sure to update the request method to match your endpoint's HTTP method.

#### Write a unit test
The most important part of this process is to make sure the new endpoint works correctly. Follow these steps to write a unit test:

1.  Open the test Go file related to your endpoint, or create one if necessary. For example, if you put your handler in [/api4/user.go](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/blob/master/server/channels/api4/user.go), your test will go in [/api4/user\_test.go](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/blob/master/server/channels/api4/user_test.go).

2.  Write your test based on the other tests in your file (or folder). There are several helper functions in [/api4/apitestlib.go](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/blob/master/server/channels/api4/apitestlib.go) that you may use.

3.  Ensure that your test covers the following:
    - All combinations of correct inputs to your endpoint.
    - Etags for your endpoint, if applicable.
    - Incorrect URL or body parameters return a **400 Bad Request** status code.
    - Requests without a token return a **401 Unauthorized** status code (for endpoints requiring a session).
    - Requests with insufficient permissions return a **403 Forbidden** status code (for endpoints requiring permission).
    - Requests to non-existent resources or URLs return a **404 Not Found** status code.

Returning the correct error code might require investigation in the [app](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/tree/master/server/channels/app) or [store](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/tree/master/server/channels/store) to find the source of errors. Status codes on errors should be set at the creation of the error.

Submit your pull request against the [mattermost/mattermost](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost) repository by [following these instructions]({{< ref "/contribute/more-info/server/developer-workflow" >}}).

### Legacy Notes

The Mattermost API used to be defined in https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-api-reference, but the source has since been moved to the [mattermost/mattermost](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost) to streamline making code and documentation changes at the same time.
