Golang ("go") is a more opinionated language than many others when it comes to coding style. The compiler enforces some basic stylistic elements, such as the removal of unused variables and imports. Many others are enforced by the `gofmt` tool, such as usage of white-space, semicolons, indentation, and alignment. The `gofmt` tool is run over all code in the Mattermost Server CI pipeline. Any code which is not consistent with the formatting enforced by `gofmt` will not be accepted into the repository.

Despite this, there are still many areas of coding style which are not dictated by these tools. Rather than reinventing the wheel, we are adopting {{< newtabref href="https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html" title="Effective Go" >}} as a basis for our style guide. On top of that, we also follow the guidelines laid out by the Go project at {{< newtabref href="https://go.dev/wiki/CodeReviewComments" title="CodeReviewComments" >}}.

However, at present, some of the guidelines from these sources come into conflict with existing patterns that are present in our codebase which cannot immediately be corrected due to the need to maintain backward compatibility.

This document, which should be read in conjunction with {{< newtabref href="https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html" title="Effective Go" >}} and {{< newtabref href="https://go.dev/wiki/CodeReviewComments" title="CodeReviewComments" >}}, outlines the small number of exceptions we make to maintain backward compatibility, as well as a number of additional stylistic rules we have adopted on top of those external recommendations.

### Application of guidelines

The following guidelines should be applied to both new and existing code. However, this does not mean that a developer is *required* to fix any surrounding code that contravenes the rules in the style guide. It's encouraged to keep fixing things as you go, but it's not compulsory to do so. Reviewers should refrain from asking for stylistic changes in surrounding code if the submitter has not included them in their pull request.

## Guidelines

### Project layout

When creating a new Go module, please follow the [standardized guidelines](https://go.dev/doc/modules/layout) of the Go team.

[This blog article](https://go.dev/blog/package-names) provides additional guidance on package names.

Following are some of the anti-patterns to keep in mind:

- Don't use the `pkg` pattern. This is a common standard used by many projects. But it goes against the Go philosophy of naming packages that signify what they contain. From https://blog.golang.org/package-names:

>  A package's name provides context for its contents, making it easier for clients to understand what the package is for and how to use it.

The `pkg` directory was used long ago in the Go project when there weren't any well-defined standards. But it was later removed to just have normal packages.

- Same for `util` or `misc` packages. Don't use them. Instead break out related `util` functionalities into its own package or if it's not used by a lot of packages, make it part of the original package itself.

- Don't have too many small packages with only one file. It's usually a sign of splitting packages without giving thought into them. Look at the API boundaries and group the packages into bigger chunks.

### Functional

#### Default to sync instead of async

Always prefer synchronous functions by default. Async calls are hard to get right. They have no control over goroutine lifetimes and introduce data races. If you think something needs to be asynchronous, measure it and prove it. Ask these questions:

- Does it improve performance? If so, by how much?
- What’s the tradeoff of the happy path vs. slow path?
- How do I propagate errors?
- What about back-pressure?
- What should be my concurrency model?

Do not create one-off goroutines without knowing when/how they exit. They cause problems that are hard to debug, and can often cause performance degradation rather than an improvement. Have a look at:

- https://go.dev/wiki/CodeReviewComments#goroutine-lifetimes
- https://go.dev/wiki/CodeReviewComments#synchronous-functions

#### Pointers to slices

Do not use pointers to slices. Slices are already reference types which point to an underlying array. If you want a function to modify a slice, then return that slice from the function, rather than passing a pointer.

#### Avoid creating more ToJSON methods

Do not create new `ToJSON` methods for model structs. Instead, just use `json.Marshal` at the call site. This has two major benefits:

- It avoids bugs due to the suppression of the JSON error which happens with `ToJSON` methods (we've had a number of bugs caused by this).
- It's a common pattern to pass the output to something (like a network call) which accepts a byte-slice, leading to a double conversion from byte-slice to string to a byte-slice again if `ToJSON` methods are used.

#### {{< newtabref href="https://go.dev/wiki/CodeReviewComments#interfaces" title="Interfaces" >}}

- Return structs, accept interfaces.
- Interface names should end with “-er”. This is not a strict rule. Just a guideline which indicates the fact that interface functionalities are designed around the concept of “doing” something.
- Try not to define interfaces on the implementer side of an API "for mocking"; instead, design the API so that it can be tested using the public API of the real implementation.

As an example, if you're trying to integrate with a third-party service, it's tempting to create an interface and use that in the code so that it can be easily mocked in the test. This is an anti-pattern and masks real bugs. Instead, you should try to use the real implementation via a docker container or if that's not feasible, mock the network response coming from the external process.

Another common pattern is to preemptively declare the interface in the source package itself, so that the consumer can just directly import the interface. Instead, try to declare the interface in the package which is going to consume the functionality. Often, different packages have non-overlapping set of functionalities to consume. If you do find several consumers of the package, remember that interfaces can be composed. So define small chunks of functionalities in different interfaces, and let consumers compose them as needed. Take a look at the set of interfaces in the {{< newtabref href="https://golang.org/pkg/io/" title="io" >}} package.

These are just guidelines and not strict rules. Understand your use case and apply them appropriately.

### Stylistic

#### {{< newtabref href="https://go.dev/wiki/CodeReviewComments#mixed-caps" title="CamelCase variables/constants" >}}

We use CamelCase names like WebsocketEventPostEdited, not WEBSOCKET_EVENT_POST_EDITED.

#### Empty string check

Use `foo == ""` to check for empty strings, not `len(foo) == 0`.

#### {{< newtabref href="https://go.dev/wiki/CodeReviewComments#indent-error-flow" title="Reduce indentation" >}}

If there are multiple return statements in an if-else statement, remove the else block and outdent it.

This is an example from `mlog/human/parser.go`:

```go
// Look for an initial "{"
if token, err := dec.Token(); err != nil {
	return result, err
} else {
	d, ok := token.(json.Delim)
	if !ok || d != '{' {
		return result, fmt.Errorf("input is not a JSON object, found: %v", token)
	}
}
```

This can be simplified to:

```go
// Look for an initial "{"
if token, err := dec.Token(); err != nil {
	return result, err
}
d, ok := token.(json.Delim)
if !ok || d != '{' {
	return result, fmt.Errorf("input is not a JSON object, found: %v", token)
}
```

#### {{< newtabref href="https://go.dev/wiki/CodeReviewComments#initialisms" title="Initialisms" >}}

Use `userID` rather than `userId`. Same for abbreviations; `HTTP` is preferred over `Http` or `http`.

#### {{< newtabref href="https://go.dev/wiki/CodeReviewComments#receiver-names" title="Receiver names" >}}

The name of a method's receiver should be a reflection of its identity; often a one or two letter abbreviation of its type suffices (such as "c" or "cl" for "Client"). Don't use generic names such as "me", "this", or "self" identifiers typical of object-oriented languages that give the variable a special meaning.

#### Error variable names

The name of any `error` variable must be `err` or prefixed with `err`. The name of any `*model.AppError` variable must be `appErr` or prefixed with `appErr`. This allows us to avoid confusion about how to handle different kind of errors inside Mattermost. If you are storing the error value from a function that returns an `error` type in its signature, it's considered an `error`, regardless of whether the function, internally, is returning a `*model.AppError` instance.

For example, when the function signature returns an `error`, we use the `err` variable name:

```go
func MyFunction() error {
    return model.NewAppError(...)
}

func OtherFunction() {
    ...
    err := MyFunction()
    ...
}
```

When the function signature returns an `*model.AppError`, we use the `appErr` variable name:

```go
func MyFunction() *model.AppError {
    return model.NewAppError(...)
}

func OtherFunction() {
    ...
    appErr := MyFunction()
    ...
}
```

### Errors

Always add proper context to errors.

#### Include the user input for validation errors.

For example:

`return fmt.Errorf("invalid export type, must be one of: csv, actiance, globalrelay")` does not include what was the input value entered by the user. It needs to be included.

Another example:

```go
if r.Start > r.End {
	return fmt.Errorf("report timestamps are erroneous")
}
```

This does not give any indication about why the report timestamps are erroneous or even what the values are. An admin reading this would find it very difficult to understand what the problem is.

A better way might be:

```go
if r.Start > r.End {
	return fmt.Errorf("report timestamps are erroneous: start_timestamp %f is greater than end_timestamp %f", r.Start, r.End)
}
```

#### Return errors instead of boolean for ID validation errors

A validation function can check various properties of an object. But if we simply return true or false, and then log that object is invalid, the user will have no idea why it is invalid or how to fix it.

For example:

```go
func IsValidId(value string) bool {
	if len(value) != 26 {
		return false
	}

	for _, r := range value {
		if !unicode.IsLetter(r) && !unicode.IsNumber(r) {
			return false
		}
	}

	return true
}
```

Here, when false is returned, there is no way to know if it is invalid because the length is not 26 characters or one of the characters is not a unicode letter or number. A better way might be:

```go
func IsValidId(value string) error {
	if len(value) != 26 {
		return fmt.Errorf("Invalid length. Found: %d; expected: %d", len(value), 26)
	}

	for _, r := range value {
		if !unicode.IsLetter(r) && !unicode.IsNumber(r) {
			return fmt.Errorf("Rune %c in %s is not an unicode letter or number", r, value)
		}
	}

	return nil
}
```

### Logging

Log messages should be annotated with contextual information in the form of key-value pairs to make it easier to identify the context they originated from. The keys should use snake_case. Refer to the corresponding JSON struct tags for key names.

```go
func (a *App) SendNotifications(...) {
	..
	_, err := a.sendOutOfChannelMentions(c, sender, post, channel, ...)
		if err != nil {
			c.Logger().Error(
				"Failed to send warning for out of channel mentions",
				mlog.String("user_id", sender.Id),
				mlog.String("post_id", post.Id),
				mlog.Err(err),
			)
		}
	..
}
```

#### Avoid double-logging

Double-logging is when you immediately log something after an error, and also return an error at the same time. This creates two log lines with the same error and is confusing to the admin.

For example:

```go
if err != nil {
	mlog.Error("Failed to generate SQL query",
		mlog.String("user_id", userID),
		mlog.Int("timestamp", int(syncTime)),
		mlog.Err(err),
	)
	return errors.Wrap(err, "failed to generate SQL query")
}
```

A better way is:

```go
if err != nil {
	return errors.Wrapf(err, "failed to generate SQL query: user_id: %s, timestamp: %d", userID, int(syncTime))
}
```

#### Log levels

The purpose of logging is to provide observability - it enables the application communicate back to the administrator about what is happening. To communicate effectively logs should be meaningful and concise. To achieve this, log lines should conform to one of the definitions below:

**Critical:** This log-level represents the most severe situations when the service is entirely unable to continue operating. After emitting a _critical_ log line, it is expected that the service will terminate.

For example, the code block below demonstrates a _critical_ situation where the server startup routine fails, meaning the service is unable to start and must terminate.

```go
func runServer(..) {
	..
	server, err := app.NewServer(options...)
	if err != nil {
		mlog.Critical(err.Error())
		return
	}
	..
}
```

**Error:** This log-level is used when something unexpected has happened to the service, but it does not result in a total loss of service. Log lines using the _error_ level must be actionable, so that the system administrator can investigate and resolve the incident. The _error_ log level may indicate a loss of service for an individual user or request or it may indicate a total failure of a non-critical subsystem within the service.

For example, the _error_ log level is used in the code snippet below as it represents a partial failure of one non-critical subsystem of the service. Administrator intervention is required to resolve this situation, but the rest of the service is able to continue operating in the meantime.

```go
func (a *App) SyncPlugins(..) {
	..
	reader, appErr := a.FileReader(plugin.path)
	if appErr != nil {
		mlog.Error("Failed to open plugin bundle from file store.", mlog.String("bundle", plugin.path), mlog.Err(appErr))
		return
	}
	..
}
```

**Warn:** This log level is used to indicate that something unexpected has happened, but the server is able to continue operating and it has not suffered any loss of functionality as a consequence of this failure. System administrators may wish to investigate the cause of log lines at this level, but the need is typically less pressing than for those at _error_ level. System administrators may also wish to monitor the rate of occurrence of individual log-lines at this level as this may be indicative of a wider problem. Log lines at the _warning_ level should be as detailed as possible, since these are often the least clear-cut category of message.

For example, the _warning_ log level may be used to indicate that something went wrong but the overall operation was still able to complete successfully.

```go
func (a *App) UpdateUserRoles(..) {
	..
	if result := <-schan; result.NErr != nil {
		// soft error since the user roles were still updated
		mlog.Warn("Error during updating user roles", mlog.Err(result.NErr))
	}

	a.InvalidateCacheForUser(userId)
	..
}
```

**Info:** This log level should be used to record normal, expected application behavior, even if it results in an error for the end user. They are not actionable individually, but the significant changes in the frequency of occurrence of individual log lines at this level may be indicative of a possible problem.

For example, the _info_ log level may be used to communicate to administrators that certain subsystems within the service have been started or stopped.

```go
func (s *Schedulers) Start(..) {
	s.startOnce.Do(func() {
		mlog.Info("Starting schedulers.")
		..
	})
	..
}
```

**Debug:** This log-level is used for diagnostic information which may be used to debug issues but is not necessary for normal production system logging, nor actionable by system administrators.

```go
func (worker *Worker) Run() {
	mlog.Debug("Worker started", mlog.String("worker", worker.name))
	..
```

### Performance sensitive areas

Any PR that can potentially have a performance impact on the `mattermost/server` codebase is encouraged to have a performance review. For more information, please see this {{< newtabref href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Uzt3XHyKhDKipkuCmESkHoPio7vz7VYS4N_5_9ffgNU/edit" title="link" >}}. The following is a brief list of indicators that should to undergo a performance review:

- New features that might require benchmarks and/or are missing load-test coverage.
- PRs touching performance of critical parts of the codebase (e.g. `Hub`/`WebConn`).
- PRs adding or updating SQL queries.
- Creating goroutines.
- Doing potentially expensive allocations: `bytes.Buffer` and `[]byte`:
	- Use of `Buffer.Grow`, `Buffer.ReadFrom`, `ioutil.ReadAll`.
	- Creating big slices and maps without capacity when size is known in advance.
- Recursion, unbounded, and deeply nested `for` loops.
- Use of locks and/or other synchronization primitives.
- Regular expressions, especially when creating `regexp.MustCompile` dynamically every time.
- Use of the `reflect` package.

## Propose a new rule

To propose a new rule, follow the process below:

- Add it to the agenda in the {{< newtabref href="https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/developers-server" title="Server" >}} Guild meeting, and propose it.
- If it gets accepted, create a go-vet rule (if possible), or a golangci-lint rule to prevent new regressions from creeping in.
- Fix all existing issues.
- Add it to this guide.
