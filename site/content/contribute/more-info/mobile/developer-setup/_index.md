{{</note>}}

## Environment setup

The following instructions apply to both iOS and Android mobile apps.
On macOS, we recommend using {{< newtabref href="https://brew.sh" title="Homebrew" >}} as a package manager.

### Install NodeJS and NPM

We recommend using NodeJS v22 and npm v10. Many of our team use {{< newtabref href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm" title="nvm" >}} to manage npm and NodeJS versions.

{{<tabs "node-npm" "node-npm-mac,macOS;node-npm-linux,Linux" "node-npm-mac">}}
{{<tab "node-npm-mac" "display: block;">}}
To install NVM using Homebrew, open a terminal and execute:

```sh
brew install nvm
```

To install NodeJS v22 LTS using NVM, open a new terminal and execute:

```shell
nvm install --lts=jod
```
{{</tab>}}
{{<tab "node-npm-linux">}}
There are three available options for installing NodeJS on Linux:

- Using NVM by following the instructions {{< newtabref href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install-script" title="here" >}}.
- Install using your distribution's package manager.
- Download and install the package from the {{< newtabref href="https://nodejs.org/en" title="NodeJS website" >}}.
{{<note>}}
The version of NodeJS that your distribution's package manager supports may not be the recommended version to build Mattermost mobile apps.
Please make sure that NodeJS installed by the package manager is at the recommended version.
{{</note>}}
{{</tab>}}

### Install Watchman

{{<newtabref href="https://facebook.github.io/watchman" title="Watchman">}} is a file watching program.
When a file changes, Watchman triggers an action, such as re-running a build command if a source file has changed.

The minimum required version of Watchman is 4.9.0.

{{<tabs "watchman" "watchman-mac,macOS;watchman-linux,Linux" "watchman-mac">}}
{{<tab "watchman-mac" "display: block;">}}
To install Watchman using Homebrew, open a terminal and execute:

```sh
brew install watchman
```
{{</tab>}}
{{<tab "watchman-linux">}}
Download the latest package from {{< newtabref href="https://github.com/facebook/watchman/releases" title="here" >}}.
{{<note "Inotify limits">}}
Note that you need to increase your `inotify` limits for Watchman to work properly.
{{</note>}}
{{</tab>}}

### Install `react-native-cli` tools

```sh
npm -g install react-native-cli
```

### Install Git

{{<tabs "git" "git-mac,macOS;git-linux,Linux" "git-mac">}}
{{<tab "git-mac" "display: block;">}}
To install Git using Homebrew, open a terminal and execute:

```sh
brew install git
```
{{</tab>}}
{{<tab "git-linux">}}
Some distributions come with Git preinstalled but you'll most likely have to install it yourself. For most distributions the package is simply called `git`.
{{</tab>}}

## Additional setup for iOS (macOS)

### Install XCode

Install {{< newtabref href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?ls=1&mt=12" title="Xcode" >}} to build and run the app on iOS. The minimum required version is 11.0.

### Install Ruby

A version of Ruby is automatically installed on macOS, but Mattermost React Native app development requires Ruby 3.2.0. You can check the current version of Ruby by running the following command.
```sh
ruby --version
```

If it isn't, we recommend using [Ruby Version Manager](https://rvm.io) or your preferred package manager to install the required version. The steps below are for using RVM.

1. Install the GPG keys for RVM using the command found [here](https://rvm.io/rvm/install#install-gpg-keys).
    1. If you don't have the `gpg` command, you can install it using Homebrew by running.
        ```sh
        brew install gnupg
        ```
2. Install the stable version of RVM using the following command.
    ```sh
    \curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
    ```
3. To load RVM, either open a new terminal or run the following command.
    ```sh
    source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm
    ```
4. Install the required version of Ruby
    ```sh
    rvm install 3.2.0
    ```
5. (Optional) If you don't need to use a different version of Ruby for anything else, you'll want to change the default version of Ruby. Without this, you'll need to run `rvm use 3.2.0` any time you want to work on the mobile app.
    ```sh
    rvm alias create default 3.2.0
    ```

## Additional setup for Android

### Download and install Android Studio or Android SDK CLI tools

Download and install the {{< newtabref href="https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html#downloads" title="Android Studio app or the Android SDK command line tools" >}}

{{<note "Default paths">}}
This documentation assumes you chose the default path for your Android SDK installation. If you chose a different path, adjust the environment variables below accordingly.
{{</note>}}

#### Environment variables

Make sure you have the following environment variables configured for your platform:

{{<tabs "droid" "droid-common,All platforms;droid-mac,macOS;droid-linux,Linux" "droid-common">}}
{{<tab "droid-common" "display: block;">}}
- Set `ANDROID_HOME` to where Android SDK is located (likely `/Users/<username>/Library/Android/sdk` or `/home/<username>/Android/Sdk`)
- Make sure your `PATH` includes `ANDROID_HOME/tools` and `ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools`
{{</tab>}}
{{<tab "droid-mac">}}
On Mac, this usually requires adding the following lines to your `~/.bash_profile` file:

```sh
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$ANDROID_HOME/emulator:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$PATH
```

Then reload your bash configuration:

```sh
source ~/.bash_profile
```

{{<note>}}
Depending on the shell you're using, this might need to be put into a different file such as `~/.zshrc`. Adjust this accordingly.
{{</note>}}
{{</tab>}}
{{<tab "droid-linux">}}
On Linux the home folder is located under `/home/<username>` which results in a slightly different path:

```sh
export ANDROID_HOME=/home/<username>/Android/Sdk
export PATH=$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:$PATH
export PATH=$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$PATH
```

Then reload your configuration

```sh
source ~/.bash_profile
```

{{<note>}}
Depending on the shell you're using, this might need to be put into a different file such as `~/.zshrc`. Adjust this accordingly.
{{</note>}}
{{</tab>}}

### Install the SDKs and SDK tools

In the SDK Manager using Android Studio or the {{< newtabref href="https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/sdkmanager.html" title="Android SDK command line tool" >}}, ensure the following are installed:

- SDK Tools (you may have to select **Show Package Details** to expand packages):
  - Android SDK Build-Tools 31
  - Android Emulator
  - Android SDK Platform-Tools
  - Android SDK Tools
  - Google Play services

## Obtain the source code

In order to develop and build the Mattermost mobile apps, you'll need to get a copy of the source code. Forking the `mattermost-mobile` repository will also make it easy to contribute your work back to the project in the future.

1. Fork the {{< newtabref href="https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile" title="mattermost-mobile" >}} repository on GitHub.

2. Clone your fork locally:

   a. Open a terminal

   b. Change to a directory you want to hold your local copy

   c. Run `git clone https://github.com/<username>/mattermost-mobile.git` if you want to use HTTPS, or `git clone git@github.com:<username>/mattermost-mobile.git` if you want to use SSH

     {{<note>}}
`<username>` refers to the username or organization in GitHub that forked the repository
     {{</note>}}

3. Change the directory to `mattermost-mobile`.

   ```sh
   cd mattermost-mobile
   ```

4. Install the project dependencies with `npm install`
