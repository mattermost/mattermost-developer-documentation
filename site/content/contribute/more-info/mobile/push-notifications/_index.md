When building a custom version of the Mattermost mobile app, you will also need to host your own [Mattermost Push Notification Service](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-push-proxy/releases) and make a few modifications to your Mattermost mobile app to be able to get push notifications.

1. Setup the custom mobile apps to receive push notifications
    - [Android]({{< ref "/contribute/more-info/mobile/push-notifications/android" >}})
    - [iOS]({{< ref "/contribute/more-info/mobile/push-notifications/ios" >}})
2. [Setup the Mattermost push notification service]({{< ref "/contribute/more-info/mobile/push-notifications/service" >}})

If the use of a proxy server is required by your IT policy, see the [corporate proxy]({{<ref "corporate-proxy">}}) page.
