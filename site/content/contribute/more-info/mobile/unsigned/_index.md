Mattermost publishes an unsigned build of the mobile app in the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/releases) page with every version that gets released.

These unsigned builds cannot be distributed nor installed directly on devices until they are properly signed.

{{<note "Note:">}}
Android and Apple require all apps to be digitally signed with a certificate before they can be installed.

To avoid rebuilding the apps from scratch, you could just **sign** the unsigned builds published by Mattermost with your certificates and keys.
