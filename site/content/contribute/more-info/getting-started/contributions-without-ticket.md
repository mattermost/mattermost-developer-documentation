Contributions for minor corrections and improvements without a corresponding `Help Wanted` ticket are welcome. For example, a pull request for a bug or incremental improvement, with less than 20 lines of code change, is usually accepted if the change to existing behaviour is minor.

All pull requests submitted without a corresponding ticket will first be reviewed by a core team product manager. Some examples of minor corrections and improvements include:

- {{< newtabref href="https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/pull/5640" title="Fix a formatting error in help text" >}}
- {{< newtabref href="https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/pull/5809" title="Fix success typo in Makefile" >}}
- {{< newtabref href="https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/pull/5612" title="Fix broken Cancel button in Edit Webhooks screen" >}}
- {{< newtabref href="https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/pull/364" title="Fix Android app crashing when saving user notification settings" >}}
- {{< newtabref href="https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost/pull/5878" title="Fix recent mentions search not working" >}}

{{<note "Note:">}}
For pull requests greater than 20 lines of code, a `Help Wanted` ticket should be opened by the core team. This helps ensure that everything going into the project aligns with a unified vision. Core committers who review the PR are entitled to reject it if there isn't a `Help Wanted` ticket and feel it significantly changes behavior or user expectations.
