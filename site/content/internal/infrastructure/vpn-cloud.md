## Setup VPN access on Pritunl

### Viscosity client   
1. Install a VPN client that supports DNS settings such as Visocity.

```bash
brew cask install viscosity
```

2. Go to the [VPN server](https://pritunl.core.cloud.mattermost.com) and select **Sign in with OneLogin**. 
Then connect with your OneLogin username and password and when prompt put the OTP (One Time Password).
Select `Show More` and hit `Download Profile`

3. Open the Viscosity application or your preferred VPN client and go to settings/preferences.
   
4. Click + to import the profile you downloaded from the VPN server on the step 1
    <span style="display:block;text-align:center;width:50%">![Viscosity Profile Add](/img/vpn_cloud_2.png)</span>

5. After your profile is imported, select to edit the entry, 

- On the General tab update the Address of the Remote Server to be: `pritunl.core.cloud.mattermost.com` as shown below:
   <span style="display:block;text-align:center;width:50%">![General settings Viscosity](/img/vpn_cloud_5.jpg)</span>

- Go to Networking tab and update the DNS settings. 
   * Select for the Mode to be `Full DNS`.  
   * As `Servers` put: `pritunl.core.cloud.mattermost.com` which is VPN's server IP.
   * In `Domains` put: `cloud.mattermost.com`, this will split traffic for those domains
    <span style="display:block;text-align:center;width:50%">![Network settings Viscosity](/img/vpn_cloud_6.jpg)</span>
    
6. Add, if it is not there, in your `/etc/resolv.conf`:
    `nameserver 10.247.0.2`

    For MacOS, first check what CIDR was in the resolv.conf with `cat /etc/resolv.conf` and then you will need to run
    `sudo networksetup -setdnsservers Wi-Fi 10.247.0.2 8.8.8.8 X.X.X.X` with your extra CIDRs that they were already in
    your resolv.conf. Also check if you are connected with Wi-Fi, or to find your available devices by running
    `networksetup -listallnetworkservices` and to replace it in the above command.

7. After following these steps you should be able to connect to VPN and then to resolve private DNS entries.
