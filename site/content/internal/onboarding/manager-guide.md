### Mentor For The Day
- Schedule a 1-1 each day between new staff and team members (including QA and PM) and other devs who would be relevant to meet with for the first two weeks
  - These meetings should be about 30 minutes and do not need to be focused on work topics. They should spend some time getting to know each other
  - The first 1-1 should be between you and the new staff member
- In addition to the above 1-1s, you should meet personally with the new staff member for 5-10 minutes every day for the first week or so to make sure everything is going well

### Channels and Teams
- Make sure new staff is added to the private team `Private Core` and all relevant channels
- See [here](/internal/onboarding/new-staff-guide/#channels-and-teams) for basic list of channels

### Meetings and Accounts
- Add new staff member to all appropriate meetings

### OneLogin Account Set-up
- Login to OneLogin and go to https://mattermost.onelogin.com/admin

- Save user, then go to Applications tab
- Add them to Developer, VPN, Vault, and Jenkins groups and save
- For the new user, go to More Actions and click Send Invitation (without this they won't get their invite)
- If the user is marked as unlicensed, ask Carlos or Corey to increase OneLogin seat count

### GitHub Group Set-up
- The membership to the Mattermost Github organization is handle by Onelogin / Lamdba function that adds the user in the correct Github Team.
