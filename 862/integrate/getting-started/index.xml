      <description>Very good question! Mattermost has many different integration points and this page will help you pick the right one(s) for the job.
I just want to post into Mattermost If you only want to post messages into a Mattermost channel, then all you need is an incoming webhook.
I want to know when someone says something Tracking what gets posted into a channel and receiving real-time events about it can be done using outgoing webhooks.</description>
