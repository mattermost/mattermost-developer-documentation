    <p>Finally, the last part of the series! We&rsquo;ve learned how the compiler uses Static Single Assignment and the rewrite rules to write and optimize intermediate code, and we&rsquo;ve dissected each and every line of the SSA generated by the compiler in the buggy function. Now it&rsquo;s time to use all that knowledge to apply a fix, which will come in the form of the most simple rewrite rule.</p>

    <p>The second part of this series of posts details the issue we are trying to fix. We are using one of the tools we learned in the first part, Static Single Assignment, to understand each and every line of the intermediate code generated by the compiler. We will even learn a tiny bit of assembly in the way.</p>

The first part of this series of posts defines the issue we are going to investigate, and introduces the parts of the Go compiler involved in its fix. We will learn about Static Single Assignment, rewrite rules and some specific incantations to hack on the Go compiler.</p>

    <hr>
    <p>Overview In the daily life of a Site Reliability Engineer the main goal is to reduce all the work we call toil. But what is toil? Toil is the kind of work tied to running a production service that tends to be manual, repetitive, automatable, tactical, devoid of enduring value, and that scales linearly as a service grows. This blog post describes our journey to automate our nodes rotation process when we have a new AMI release, and the open source tools we built on this.</p>

    <p>Languages are complicated, and every language is complicated in different ways that can be hard to understand without learning every single one of them. Some languages form words from multiple characters while others have symbols that represent entire concepts. Some feature words without pluralization or gender and rely on context for that while others have two or even more genders for words. Some are very phonetic while others pronounce words seemingly at random (cough English, though cough).</p>

    <p>Optimizing SQL queries is always fun, except when it isn&rsquo;t. If you&rsquo;re a MySQL veteran and have read the title, you already know where this is heading 😉. In that case, allow me to regale the uninitiated reader.
This is the story of an (apparently) smart optimization to a SQL query that backfired spectacularly and how we finally fixed it.
Act I: A slow query It started off with a customer noticing that a SQL query was running slowly in their environment.</p>

    <p>At the start of implementing Docker Content Trust in our workflow, I thought it shouldn&rsquo;t take so long. I thought and of course I was wrong. The following is the boiled down version of what I learned and wished for starting out.
Prerequisites  Docker version: 19.03.12 root *.key + passphrase for the Docker Content Trust delegation/signer private key *.key + public key *.pub + passphrase for the delegated person/bot, who should sign the repository/image:tag Please make sure you have your keys backed up and versioned.</p>

    <p>Have you ever wondered how many active users your application can handle at the same time? If so, you&rsquo;re not alone. Here at Mattermost we&rsquo;re building a highly concurrent messaging platform for team collaboration that needs to potentially serve up to several thousands of users simultaneously.
While standard functional testing (e.g. unit tests) is critical to verify correct behavior of your application, it&rsquo;s usually not sufficient to guarantee its performance at scale.</p>
