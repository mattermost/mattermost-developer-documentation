    <small>Read about how Mattermost uses Hermes, Facebook’s new JavaScript engine, to boost performance.</small>
    <hr>
    <p>With the upgrade to React Native 61 came the prospect of substantially improving performance of our Android app. How? Through the use of Hermes, Facebook’s new JavaScript engine. To say that we were excited is an understatement. And with that excitement came curiosity: how is this new JavaScript engine achieving performance boosts?
Let’s first chat a bit about JS engines in general.
How does your JavaScript code eventually get executed by the CPU on the machine?</p>

    <small>Learn about what the remote onboarding process is like for new hires at Mattermost.</small>
    <hr>
    <p>I recently joined Mattermost as a Remote Software Engineer and while I’ve worked in remote environments before, I was really surprised at how amazing this company is to work with. During my onboarding I discovered that they have really developed a culture built around being remote; one that allowed for me to feel as part of a larger team and always engaged, rather than separated from my peers and working alone.</p>

    <small>Takeaways from our team&#39;s experience at KubeCon &#43; CloudNativeCon North America 2019.</small>
    <hr>
    <p>It wasn’t my first time flying. It also wasn’t the first time I had arrived at the airport early enough to require multiple cups of coffee. As I sat at my gate, however, I did find myself wondering for the first time: had I ever heard the words “Lambda,” “stateful set&rdquo;, and “yaml” while waiting to board?
You see, a bunch of us were coming from all over to attend KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2019.</p>

    <small>Monitoring the state of your clusters is an effective way to discover bottlenecks in your multi-cluster production environment.</small>
    <hr>
    <p>Monitoring the state of your clusters is an effective way to discover bottlenecks in your multi-cluster production environment. It is one of the key challenges that development teams are facing and factors such as the team experience as well as the number and distribution of the applications can make things even more complex.
Better monitoring can help identify single points of failure. Being able to get information about things like the number of applications running on each node or the CPU and memory performance can help to get closer to zero downtime deployments.</p>

    <small>Matterpoll is a plugin that allows users to create polls in Mattermost. Learn about how we localized it.</small>
    <hr>
    <p>Matterpoll is a plugin that allows users to create polls in Mattermost. Since Mattermost is localized in 16 different languages, it’s optimal that Matterpoll is similarly localized.
Because we rely on contributors to do the translations, we want to make it easy for them to translate new strings and determine whether already translated strings need to be updated because the &ldquo;source&rdquo; text changed. On the other hand, Matterpoll only has two maintainers (@kaakaa and me) and no infrastructure of its own to work with.</p>

    <p>Mattermost is starting a new Open Source campaign, this time around increasing the unit test coverage for the mmctl tool.
The mmctl tool is a CLI application that mimics the commands and features of the current Mattermost CLI tool and uses the Mattermost REST API to communicate with the server. Using the tool, you can control and manage several Mattermost servers without having to access the specific machine on which the server is running.</p>

    <small>Learn about what Go AST is, why we need it, and instrumenting our handlers with tracing code.</small>
    <hr>
    <p>We&rsquo;ve been working on integrating call tracing in the server to provide exact measurements of all API and DB calls. We&rsquo;ve picked OpenTracing - a lovely open source project that allows you to setup trace reporting and enables you to support Distributed tracing.
Instrumenting your API handler in Go is very straightforward - setup a connection to a collection server supporting the OpenTracing spec (we&rsquo;ve decided to use Jaeger) and wrap your code in spans.</p>

    <p>I recently acquired a copy of Charles, the well-known Web Debugging Proxy Application. I&rsquo;ve actually stumbled across this product on multiple occasions, but never bothered to actually try it&hellip; almost exclusively because I thought the website looked a little dated. In trying to suss out the root cause behind MM-19091, I needed a way to debug against our community servers but running with my local copy of the mattermost webapp. This would allow me to insert console.</p>

 This comment on a pull request is crushing. After all the effort you&rsquo;ve spent writing your code, adding new unit tests, and rebasing your changes to make each commit almost a work of art: how could your tests possibly be failing?
Begrudgingly, you sign into your CI server only to realize the failing tests have nothing to do with your code. You think, &ldquo;Hmm, maybe the code is more coupled than I expected.</p>

    <p>- Yes, yes... - for real? - Yes I come all the way from Taiwan... and you? - Oh I'm from here.. and what about you - me? hmm I flew 18 hours to get here (me) In short, the above is how the whole thing started. It is really interesting how people from all over the globe attended the event. It was a fun learning experience and even the unexpected was waiting on us.</p>
